# Google Stock Price Dataset with LSTM RNN

This repository contains code and data related to training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model on the Google stock price dataset. The goal is to predict future stock prices based on historical data using deep learning techniques.

## Data Description

The dataset (google_stock_price.csv) consists of daily stock price values for Google from [YYYY-MM-DD] to [YYYY-MM-DD]. Each row represents a single day's trading information, including features such as opening price, closing price, highest and lowest prices of the day, and volume traded.

The columns in the dataset include:
- Date: Date of the trading session
- Open: Opening price at the beginning of the trading session
- High: Highest recorded price during the trading session
- Low: Lowest recorded price during the trading session
- Close: Closing price at the end of the trading session
- Volume: Number of shares traded during that day

## Objective

The main objective with this project is to train an LSTM RNN model using historical data from previous days' stock prices in order to forecast future prices accurately. By inputting past sequences of prices into our model, we aim to capture temporal patterns and dependencies that can be used for predicting future trends.

## Usage

To use this codebase:

1. Clone or download this repository onto your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies mentioned in requirements.txt.
3. Run main.py or explore other Python scripts provided.
4. Adjust hyperparameters like batch size, number of epochs, etc., according to your requirements.
5. Experiment with different network architectures or pre-processing techniques if desired.
6. Analyze/visualize results obtained by evaluating predictions against actual test/validation data.
7. Customize the code to fit your specific research or trading strategy needs.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries (such as TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, Matplotlib) installed.
2. Prepare your dataset by loading it into a suitable data structure (e.g., Pandas DataFrame).
3. Preprocess the data by normalizing/standardizing features, splitting into training/validation/test sets, etc.
4. Build an LSTM RNN model using frameworks like TensorFlow or Keras.
5. Train the model on historical stock price sequences and tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
6. Evaluate the trained model on validation/test sets using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., mean squared error).
7. Use the trained model to make predictions on unseen/future data points for forecasting purposes.
